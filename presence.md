# Presence · Operational State

This repository operates without urgency.

Updates may occur.
They are not scheduled.
They do not respond to demand.

No roadmap is published.
No audience is assumed.
No growth is targeted.

Economic interaction, if it occurs,
is considered a side effect,
not a goal.

Automation, when enabled,
will preserve this state.
Any system that violates it
is considered incompatible.

This project does not compete.
It coexists.
